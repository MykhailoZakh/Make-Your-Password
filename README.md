# Make-Your-Password
Adding JavaScript code for Password Generator web aplicattion
## Description

I made a JS code base for Password Generator web application. I added popout windows to collect information about password that user want to create after he used a button inside of the website . First promp window asking about length of the password (It can be only between 8 and 128), and next four confrim windows checking what kind of password parameters user want for his generated password.
